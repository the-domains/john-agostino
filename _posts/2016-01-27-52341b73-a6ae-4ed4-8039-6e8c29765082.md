John Agostino is an American Novelist born on September 3, 1959, in Brooklyn, New York. As the son of Italian immigrants, he effortlessly translates this robust culture and uses it as a rich, but subtle backdrop for his novels.

John's tenth grade English teacher, Ms. Carmichael, spotted him as a true writer when she read his Thanksgiving essay written from the turkey's perspective. He waited many years before heeding her advice to make writing a profession, but his perspective is still both haunting and hilarious.

Reality dominated the years between those early works and today. According to John, it's been a good reality---one not completely dissimilar from that of the loving and bewildered protagonists in his stories. John and his wife are the proud parents of four children.

His reality is fine; however, his passion involves escaping reality. This is what makes John an effective fiction writer. Readers grab his stories and hang on, much in the way we all navigate life at times.

John says his qualifications for the writing profession are the ingredients of a happy life, an overactive imagination, and a willingness to work hard.

Mostly though, he loves to write.
